# Powerdeploy - Deceivingly Simple Deployments #

Powerdeploy is a lightweight application deployment tool built on [PowerShell][] that is simple enough to get up and running right away but powerful enough to deploy just about any application.

Guiding Principles:

* Simple to start with: Powerdeploy, at its foundation, provides a very narrow and specific set of functionality that makes it easy to get started without weeding through manuals or wading through videos.
* Extensible to grow with: Powerdeploy provides extensions, and extensibility that can make even complicated application deployments easy.
* Independent of other infrastructure and tools: Powerdeploy does not depend on other deployment workflow tools or installation frameworks.  Powerdeploy can be used on its own, from your workstation to deploy an application on demand, or in collaboration with workflow, continuous integration, and continuous deployment tools to provide application deployments in situations where rigorous processes are followed.  

## So Simple ##

Getting basic...
