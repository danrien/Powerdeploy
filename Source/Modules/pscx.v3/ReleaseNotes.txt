PowerShell Community Extensions 3.0 Release Notes
May 15, 2012

The primary purpose of the Pscx 3.0 release is to fully support Windows
PowerShell V3.  This version of Pscx is compiled against .NET 4.0 and
takes advantage of PowerShell V3 specific features.  This version of 
Pscx WILL NOT RUN on PowerShell V2.  

If you need Pscx support for PowerShell V2, please download the latest 
Pscx 2.1.x.x version from http://pscx.codeplex.com.

If you need support for Windows PowerShell 1.0, you can still download the 
Pscx 1.2 release.  The other major change is that Pscx no longer uses an MSI 
installer.  In fact, the "install" is merely an xcopy deployment of the Pscx 
module into your modules folder (~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules).  


NOTES ABOUT XCOPY DEPLOYMENT

Files downloaded from the web are usually blocked on Windows including the 
Pscx-3.0.0.0.zip file.  If you do not unblock the ZIP file first then each of the 
files extracted from the ZIP will also be blocked.  This will cause numerous 
errors when you import Pscx like this:

Import-Module : The following error occurred while loading the extended type 
data file:
Microsoft.PowerShell, C:\Users\Keith\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Pscx\
TypeData\Pscx.FeedStore.Type.ps1xml : File skipped because of the following 
validation exception: File C:\Users\Keith\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\
Pscx\TypeData\Pscx.FeedStore.Type.ps1xml cannot be loaded. The file C:\Users\
Keith\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Pscx\TypeData\Pscx.FeedStore.Type.ps
1xml is not digitally signed. The script will not execute on the system. 
Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details...

To avoid these errors follow the unblocking directions below.


UNBLOCKING THE PSCX-3.0.0.0.zip FILE:

1. Locate the PSCX-3.0.0.0.zip file in Windows Explorer.
2. Right-click on the file and select "Properties".
3. On the General tab of the Properties dialog, locate the "Unblock" button in
   the lower right-hand corner and press.


COPYING THE PSCX MODULE INTO YOUR MODULE DIR

Once you have unblocked the PSCX-3.0.0.0.zip, extract the contents of the ZIP file
to your $env:Home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder.  If this folder 
doesn't exist then you will need to create it.  If you want Pscx to be avaible
to all users on a computer, then extract the files to $PSHome\Modules instead.


UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF PSCX

Pscx 3.0 does not automatically upgrade Pscx 2.1.  In fact, these two versions 
of Pscx can live side-by-side.  


IMPORTING THE PSCX MODULE

Importing the Pscx module is very easy.  Just execute:

C:\PS> Import-Module Pscx

If you want to import Pscx in your profile, all you have to do is add the 
command above to your profile.  Pscx can be customized in terms of 
preference variables and what nested modules are automatically loaded.  In the
root dir of the Pscx module there is a file named Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1.  
It shows the default values for the preference variable and which nested 
modules are loaded by default.  If you want to change any of these, copy this 
file to your WindowsPowerShell dir or your home dir, edit it and then pass 
the path to this modified Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file to Import-Module e.g.:

C:\PS> Import-Module Pscx -arg ~\Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1

Pscx will now be imported with your preferences.


WINDOWS EXPLORER CONTEXT MENU ITEM - "Open PowerShell Here"

Since Pscx no longer uses an installer, if you want to enable the Windows 
Explorer context menu item that opens a PowerShell prompt on any drive or 
folder you will need to execute the Enable-OpenPowerShellHere command.

MISC UPDATES:
        
    Accelerators
        Pscx adds two new accelarators [wmidatetime] and [wmitimespan] which 
        can be used to convert .NET DateTime and TimeSpan values into their
        WMI equivalents e.g.:
        
        C:\PS> [wmidatetime](get-date)
        20100411113710.551365-360
        
        C:\PS> [wmitimespan]((get-date) - (get-date).AddHours(-1))
        00000000010000.000000:000
        
        Note that converting from a WMI datetime or WMI timespan to the .NET
        equivalent can be accomplished by simply type casting e.g.:
        
        C:\PS> [datetime]'20100409131034.881722-360'
        Friday, April 09, 2010 1:10:34 PM
        
        You can also use [accelerators] as a shortcut to find all the 
        accelerators available in PowerShell e.g.:
        
        C:\PS> [accelerators]::get

        Key                    Value
        ---                    -----
        int                    System.Int32
        long                   System.Int64
        string                 System.String
        char                   System.Char
        bool                   System.Boolean
        byte                   System.Byte
        double                 System.Double
        ...
        wmidatetime            Pscx.TypeAccelerators.WmiDateTime
        wmitimespan            Pscx.TypeAccelerators.WmiTimeSpan
